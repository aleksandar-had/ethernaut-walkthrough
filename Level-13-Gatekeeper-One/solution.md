The different aspects of this challenge don't fit well in a short summary, that's why if you want to find out more, head to [Walkthrough [#4]](https://aleksandar-had.medium.com/ethernaut-walkthrough-4-796c59b842bd)

After deploying the attack contract, a user only has to call the ```attackGatekeeperOne()``` function with the appropriate ```gateKey``` value, in my case that was ```0x100000000000ddc4```.
